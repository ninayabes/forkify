# forkify 


Forkify is a JavaScript application that interacts with the forkify API to fetch and display recipe food data. The app uses modern JavaScript tools (Webpack to bundle the modules and Babel for version compatibility). The user can search for a specific recipe, create a new recipe, and save to a favorites bookmark via local storage.

The app is deployed and available to use:
